## Getting Started

### Add the SDK to the project
#### 1. In your <font color="green">pubspec.yaml</font> add the following lines:

```js
dependencies:
  wonder_payment_plugin: ^1.0.0
```

#### 2. If it is iOS, 
in your <font color="green">Info.plist</font>, add the following lines:

```js
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Editor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>payment_sdk_demo</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>YOUR_APP_SCHEME</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

If you use <font color="orange">Wechat Pay</font>, you must add a dependency


```js
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
		<string>Editor</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
		<string>wechat_pay</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
		<array>
			<string>YOUR_WECHAT_APP_ID</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
```

If Android:

Create an empty Activity in the application package name directory and add the following to the manifest file:
```js
<activity-alias
    android:name=".wxapi.WXPayEntryActivity"
    android:exported="true"
    android:targetActivity="com.wonder.payment.sdk.wxapi.WXPayEntryResultActivity" />
        android:targetActivity="com.wonder.payment.sdk.wxapi.WXPayEntryResultActivity" />
```

#### 3. If iOS

In your AppDelegate.swift add the following lines:
```js
func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {
    return WonderPayment.handleOpenURL(url: url)
}

func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return WonderPayment.handleOpenURL(url: url)
}
```


### Initiate the SDK
To initiate the SDK, customer needs know:

  -Set Up the Payment Configurations. Retrieve `appID` as a first step when initiating the SDK when you onboard on Wonder, in order to get access to our Payment Gateway configurations. For specific methods such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Wechat Pay, you will be required to apply directly with the schemes in order to obtain the unique identifier, for the activation of those methods.

  -To set up a method for future payments, you must generate a `customerID` for Tokenisation process.

  -Customer can opt to customise the UI of the payment elements, or follow the default UI settings.

#### Set up payment configuration




```js
WonderPaymentPlugin.init(
    paymentConfig: PaymentConfig(
      environment: PaymentEnvironment.staging, // [staging | alpha | production]
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      fromScheme: "YOUR_APP_SCHEME",
      wechat: WechatConfig(
        appId: "WECHAT_APP_ID",
        universalLink: "YOUR_APP_UNIVERSAL_LINK",
      ),
      applePay: ApplePayConfig(
        merchantIdentifier: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_IDENTIFIER',
        merchantName: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_NAME',
        countryCode: 'HK',
      ),
      googlePay: GooglePayConfig(
        merchantName: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_NAME',
        merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_IDENTIFIER',
        countryCode: 'HK',
        currencyCode: 'HKD',
      ),
    ),
    uiConfig: UIConfig(
      displayStyle: DisplayStyle.confirm,
    ),
  );
```

 The attributes of UIConfig are as follows：

 ```js
class UIConfig {
  Color? background;
  Color? secondaryBackground;
  Color? primaryTextColor;
  Color? secondaryTextColor;
  Color? secondaryButtonColor;
  Color? secondaryButtonBackground;

###  Initialize Payment Intent, and Complete Payment Immediately
Upon successful SDK configuration set up, the customer can initialize and open Wonder pre-built payment session for every payment intent. The app user can select the pre-enabled payment options in the pre-built UI page to complete the payment. This flow is to trigger and complete payment continuously in one flow.

```js
final intent = PaymentIntent(
    amount: 0.1,
    currency: "HKD",
    orderNumber: "202403081229292766405205",
  );

final result = await WonderPaymentPlugin.present(intent);
```

### Present result object [PaymentResult]
This section presents the result of the payment intent.

|   Variable   | Type     | Required | Description                     |
| :----------- | :-----   | :------- | :----------------------------   |
| status  | enum | Y        | Completed, Canceled, Failed,    |
| code  | string| N     | If the payment goes wrong, an error code is returned   |
| message  | string  | N        | If the payment goes wrong, an error message is returned   |

###  Alternative Flow - Initialize Payment Intent, and Pay Later
Alternatively, the customer can choose to initialize the payment intent, and save the payment method option, and then pay later during the checkout process. This is suitable for customer that wishes to let their payer to pre-choose the default payment method first (step 1), and then complete payment later (step 2).
```js
Step 1: Select payment method

final intent = PaymentIntent(
    amount: 0.1,
    currency: "HKD",
    orderNumber: "202403081229292766405205",
  );

final method = await WonderPaymentPlugin.select(intent.transactionType);
intent.paymentMethod = method;

Step 2: Start the payment process

final result = await WonderPaymentPlugin.pay(intent);
```
